# Bitonic Sorting
####Implementation of Bitonic Sorting algorithm on FPGA through SDAccel using Opencl as source code
In this experiment Opencl description of bitonic sorting algorithm is used as a source code to be digested by SDAccel which targets xilinx FPGAs. However, same Opencl code is run on GPU for compariosn purpose but the main goal of this experiment is to see and explore FPGA design flow using SDAccel and its capabilities.
