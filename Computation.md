### LATENCY = [512 + (512 + 513) + 66600 + (514 +513)] * 4 ns =  290 usecond


first plot: always size is changing from 4 to 32:

 1) Plot for Different Data Size Total Time exectution for sortlocal1 and see the effect of async work group copy versus default implementation.
 
 
 2) Plot Data Transfer rate using async work group copy and multiple Compute Unit versus DEFAULT.
 
 
 3) Draw a Table which Presents the best Latency of the algorithm and report it and compare it with GPU.
